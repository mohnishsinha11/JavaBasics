#ThreadGroup
 -> based on functionality we can group threads into a single unit which is called as ThreadGroup. That is ThreadGroup contains a group of threads.
 -> In addition to that ThreadGroup can also contain sub thread groups.
 -> Examples of ThreadGroup all producer threads, all consumer threads.
 -> Advantage is we can perform common operation easily.
 -> Every thread in java belongs to some ThreadGroup and every thread is child group of system directly or indirectly.
 -> ThreadGroup is a direct child of Object Class and present in java.lang package

#java.util.concurrent package
 -> problems with traditional synchronized keyword
    1. we are not having any flexibility to try for a lock without waiting
    2. there is no way to specify maximum waiting time for a thread to get lock so that thread will wait until getting the lock which may
       create performance problem, which may cause deadlock
    3. if a thread releases a lock then which waiting thread will get the lock, we are not having any control on this
    4. there is no api to list out all waiting threads for a lock
    5. synchronized keyword compulsory we have to use either at the method level or within a method, and it is not possible to use across
       multiple methods

    - To overcome these problems some people introduced java.util.concurrent.locks package from 1.5 version
    - This package also provides several enhancements to the programmer to provide more control on concurrency.

 *Lock interface
 -> Lock object is similar to implicit lock acquired by a thread to execute synchronized method/block
 -> Lock implementation provide more extensive operation than traditional implicit locks

     - important methods of lock interface
      1. void lock():
        - we can use this method to acquire a lock, if lock is already available then immediately current thread will get the lock.
        - if lock is not already available then it will wait until getting the lock.
        - it is exactly same behaviour of traditional synchronized keyword.

      2. boolean trylock():
        - to acquire the lock without waiting
        - if the lock is available then thread acquires that lock and returns true;
        - if the lock is not available then this method returns false and can continue its execution without waiting. In this case
          thread never will enter into waiting state.

          ex.
          if(l.trylock()){
                perform safe operations
          }
          else{
                perform alternative operations
          }

      3. boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit):
        - if lock is available then thread with get the lock and continue its execution
        - if the lock is not available then the thread will wait until specified amount of time,
        - still if the lock is not available then thread can continue its execution

        TimeUnit - TimeUnit is an enum present in java.lang.concurrent, contains enums as nanosecs, microsecs, millisecs, secs, mins, hours, days

        ex.
        if(l.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS){

        }

       4. void lockInterruptibly():
        - acquires the lock if it is available and return immediately
        - if the lock is not available then it will wait
        - while waiting if the thread is interrupted then thread won't get the lock

       5. void unlock():
        - to release the lock
        - to call this method compulsory current thread should be owner of the lock otherwise we will get runtime exception saying
          IllegalMonitorStateException

 *ReentrantLock
 -> ReentrantLock is the implementation class for Lock interface, and it is a direct child class of Object
 -> Reentrant means a thread can acquire same lock multiple times without any issue
 -> internally, reentrant lock increments thread's personal count whenever thread calls lock() method and decrements internal count value
    whenever thread calls unlock() method and lock will be released whenever count reaches zero

    - Constructors
        1. ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock();
        2. ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock(boolean fairness);
            - creates ReentrantLock lock with the given fairness policy
            - if the fairness is true then longest waiting thread can acquire th lock if it is available,
            - hence it follows the FCFS policy
            - if fairness is false which waiting thread will get the chance we can't expect,
            - the default value for the fairness is false

    - Important methods of ReentrantLock
        1. void lock()
        2. boolean tryLock()
        3. boolean tryLock(long, TimeUnit)
        4. void lockInterruptibly()
        5. void unlock()
        6. int getHoldCount() - returns no. of hold on the lock by current thread
        7. boolean isHeldByCurrentThread() - returns true if and only if lock is hold by current thread
        8. int getQueueLength() - returns no. of threads waiting for the lock
        9. Collection getQueuedThreads() - returns a collection of threads which are waiting to get the lock
        10. boolean hasQueuedThreads() - returns true if any thread waiting to get the lock
        11. boolean isLocked() - returns true if the lock is acquired by some thread
        12. boolean isFair() - returns true if the fairness policy is set with true value
        13. Thread getOwner() - returns the thread which acquires the lock

#Thread Pools(Executor Framework)
 -> creating a new thread for every job may create performance and memory problems, to overcome this we should go for ThreadPool.
 -> ThreadPool is a pool of already created threads ready to do our job.
 -> Java 1.5 version introduces ThreadPool framework to implements Thread Pools.
 -> ThreadPool Framework also known as Executor Framework
 -> We can create a ThreadPool as follows:
        ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

 -> We can submit a runnable job by using submit() method
        service.submit(job);

 -> We can shut down ExecutorService using shutdown() method
        service.shutdown();

    Note:
        -> While designing web servers or application servers, we can use ThreadPool concept

 *Callable and Future
 -> In case of Runnable job, thread won't return anything after completing the job,
 -> if a thread is required to return some result after execution, then we should go for callable
 -> Callable interface contains only one method call()
        public Object call() throws Exception
 -> If we submit a callable object to executor then after completing the job thread returns an object of the type Future.
 -> That is Future object can be used to retrieve the result from the callable job.

#ThreadLocal
 -> ThreadLocal class provides thread local variables
 -> ThreadLocal class maintains values per thread basis
 -> Each ThreadLocal object maintain a separate value, like userId, transactionId, etc. for each thread that access that object.
 -> Thread can access its local value, can manipulate its value and even can remove its value.
 -> In every part of the code which is executed by the thread, we can access its local variable.
    Example - consider a Servlet which invokes some business method, we have a requirement to generate a unique transactionId for
    each and every request, and we have to pass this transactionId to the business methods. For this requirement we can use ThreadLocal to
    maintain a separate transactionId for every request i.e. for every thread.

    Note -
    - ThreadLocal class introduced in 1.2 version and enhanced in 1.5 version
    - ThreadLocal can be associated with Thread scope
    - Total code which is executed by thread has access to the corresponding thread local variables
    - a thread can access its own local variables and can't access other thread's local variables
    - once thread enter into dead state, all its local variables are by default eligible for Garbage Collection
    - constructor ThreadLocal t1 = new ThreadLocal(), creates a ThreadLocal variable.
    - methods:
        1. Object get() - returns the value of the ThreadLocal variable associated with current Thread
        2. Object initialValue() - returns initial value of ThreadLocal variable associated with current Thread
                                 - the default implementation of this method return null
                                 - to customize our own initial value we have to override this method
        3. void set(Object newValue) - to set a new value
        4. void remove() - to remove the value of Thread Local variable associated with current thread
                         - this method is added in 1.5 version
                         - after removal if we try to access it will reinitialize again by invoking its initialValue method()

    ThreadLocal vs Inheritance
    - Parent threads ThreadLocal variable by default not available to the child thread
    - If we want to make parent thread's ThreadLocal value available to the child thread, then we should go for InheritableThreadLocalClass
    - By default child thread value is exactly same as parent thread's value, but we can customize child thread's value by overriding
      childValue() Method
    - constructor : InheritableThreadLocal t1 = new InheritableThreadLocal();
    - methods :
          - InheritableThreadLocal is a child class of ThreadLocal and hence all methods present in ThreadLocal by default available to
            InheritableThreadLocal
          - In addition to these methods, it contains only one method:
                public Object childValue(Object parentValue);
